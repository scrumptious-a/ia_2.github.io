    <h2> Trait & Emotion</h2>
    <p> Trait: A passion for learning drives me to explore topics beyond what's required of me, seeking additional resources, and engaging deeply with course material/s. </p>
     <p> Impact: This can lead to a deeper understanding of subjects, a desire to excel academically, and the development of expertise in specific areas whether weak or strong.</p>

     <p> <q>The greatest triumph of evil is for good man to keep quiet</q>- Patrick K. St. F Hadden </p>
     <p> <span class="indented-first-word">I </span>chose my dad as my hero because he embodies the qualities of unwavering support and guidance. 
        His unconditional love and wisdom have been a constant source of strength throughout my life. 
        He has not only protected and provided for our family but has also served as a role model for integrity and hard work. 
        His presence and influence have shaped me into the person I am today, and I'm endlessly grateful for the deep emotional bond and enduring legacy he has created in my life.</p>

    <h2> Keirsey Temperament Sorter Personality Test </h2>
    <img src="../assets/keirsey.jpg" alt="dad" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p>The results from taking the Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test display a result that deemed me as a <em>portrait of a Guardian</em> . 
        However, personality tests have general validity but may not fully capture individual complexity. In my case, they provide some insights but aren't definitive.
